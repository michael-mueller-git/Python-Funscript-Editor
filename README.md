Simple Funscript Editor written in Python with an motion tracking add-on to partially automate the generation of funscripts for static video scenes like vr videos.

## Getting Started

Python Funscript Editor has an simple UI to perform basic operations to generate a funscript. Due to the UI limitations it is not intended for productive use. Therefore i create a lua script to integrate the motion tracking funscript generator (MTFG) in [Open Funscripter (OFS)](https://github.com/OpenFunscripter/OFS). For the Installation see my detailed step by step [OFS Integration instruction](https://github.com/michael-mueller-git/Python-Funscript-Editor/blob/main/docs/app/docs/user-guide/ofs-integration.md). Advanced user should read the [configuration page](https://github.com/michael-mueller-git/Python-Funscript-Editor/blob/main/docs/app/docs/user-guide/config.md) in the application documentation.
