# Python Funscript Editor Config

The configuration files for the Windows release version are located in the `funscript-editor/funscript_editor/config` directory. If you use the python source code directly they are located in [`funscript_editor/config`](https://github.com/michael-mueller-git/Python-Funscript-Editor/tree/main/funscript_editor/config).

## Config Files

The directory contains several config files. The most interesting are `settings.yaml` and `hyperparameter.yaml`. When editing the `*.yaml` configuration files, pay attention to the formatting, otherwise the program will not work later.

Config Files:

- `hyperparameter.yaml`: hyperparameter for the algorithms
- `logging_linux.yaml`: the logging configuration for linux
- `logging_windows.yaml`: the logging configuration for windows
- `settings.yaml`: application settings
- `ui.yaml`: user interface settings
- `projection.yaml`: the FFmpeg filter parameter for different video types. You can change the keys for the zooming, rotation, ... for each video projection configuration.

All available config parameter are described with an comment inside the config file.
